	We all spend a lot of time in our phones doing researches of a new company to go to for some services, checking emails, using useful mobile applications or simply spending time browsing friends posts in social networks. Either it's a next service that you need to schedule for your car or it's a desire to check what type of apple juice the nearest grocery stores have on sale or maybe deliver food to you from your favourite restaurant. Even for scheduling doctor's appointment or buying a flight ticket we use mobile phones.
