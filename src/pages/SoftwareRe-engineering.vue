        Many systems, either it's a small website or a big enterprise system, that are in use nowadays are pretty outdated and are not able to cope up with requirements for speed of response, modern design trends or user experience. Customers want not only the reliable system to use, but also easy to use one. The process of re-building an outdated system can be pretty tricky. Changing the way how it looks like it's important to preserve the way how it operates and behaves in terms of business requirements.
