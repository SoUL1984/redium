            When making a software, either a small system for an individual entrepreneur or a large corporate multimillion dollar portal, everything needs to be fully tested before rolling it our to your customers to consume. Releasing a newly created system? Have all the part of the system been tested? Are all of them working as expected? Or maybe releasing the next version of your software? Has it been checked for regression?  Are all its parts still operating as expected and as they used to? All these topics can be very tricky and require a lot of attention especially in those areas of business like banking or medical care.
