        Have you ever thought of selling your business after some time? Or step aside from its operational side and focus more on business growth and development? Or perhaps hire new employees to join the operational side of you product? You might come up with such a decision any time and it will require some actions from you to take. If selling a business how things are going to be hand over to a new owner? Are the processes in your business documented well enough for a new owner to fully understand how the whole system runs? Same if you want to step aside and bring new people in charge or your operational business side. As a business owner how are you going to pass them all the knowledge that you have in your head currently?
        <br><br>
        Well documented systems are worth much more as it is much easier for others to take it over. Digital part of your business has to be also well documented. The processes that are there in your online system, the architecture of the entire system and user manuals are essentials documents that every company must have. Want to extend or improve you customers booking system, for instance? You'll have to fully understand how it works to avoid nasty surprises later when this module will become incompatible with the others in your system. But surely such things won't happen as it will be tested first before releasing it to customers.
