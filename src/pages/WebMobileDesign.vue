	Great design for you mobile app or an online system is a very important part that has to be taken care thoroughly. The more attractive and intuitive the design is, the more likely users will keep using your system and feel satisfied while using it. Beautiful design is not the only part that you need to take care of while creating it for your business. User experience (UX) is the other also very important part of the process. If a system is very well designed and looks perfect but haven't thought through properly in terms of data flow and user experience, users might stop using it and go to competitors as it can be very frustrating to keep calling customer support as it is very confusing how to use the system.
